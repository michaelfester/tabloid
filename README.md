Note: Chrome Beta channel or later needs to be installed in order for the plugin to work.

## Installation

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Bring up the extensions management page by clicking the Chrome menu icon and choosing Tools > Extensions.
* If Developer mode has a + by it, click the + to add developer information to the page. The + changes to a -, and more buttons and information appear.
* Click the Load unpacked extension button. A file dialog appears.
* In the file dialog, navigate to the extension's folder and click OK.

## Usage

The extension consists of four keyboard shortcuts:

* Alt-Shift-L: move tab one position to the right
* Alt-Shift-H: move tab one position to the left
* Alt-Shift-K: move tab to the first position
* Alt-Shift-J: move tab to the last position

## Tabasco

A separate extension, tabasco, adds the following shortcuts to Chrome

* Close other Tabs
* Close Tabs to the right
* Pin tab

Chrome extensions currently only allow for a maximum of four shortcuts, which is why they are not included in tabloid.
